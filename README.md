Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to align three identical marks, either "X" or "O", in a row â€” horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Player X usually starts first, and the players take turns placing their marks in the empty cells. If a player succeeds in forming a line of three, they win the game.
